            <h4>What is Powerball?</h4>
            <p>Powerball is a lottery game that draws 5 winning white numbers 
                between 1 and 69, and 1 winning Powerball (red number) between 1 and 26.
                The two sets of numbers (white and red) are drawn 
                from two different drums.
                The Powerball rules changed on October 4th, 2015, so this data covers
                draws beginning from that date.
