            <h4>What is Powerball?</h4>
            <p>
                Powerball is a lottery game that draws 5 winning 
                <span class="text">white numbers</span> 
                between 1 and 69, and 1 winning 
                <span class="text">Powerball</span> (red number) between 1 and 26.
                The two sets of numbers (white and red) are drawn 
                from two different drums. The Powerball rules changed on October 4th, 
                2015, so this data covers draws beginning from that date.
